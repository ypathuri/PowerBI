# NYC Public Schools Dashboard in PowerBI
# My key takeaways:
1. Analysis of the data reveals that Staten Island and Manhattan Boroughs exhibit a
significant 60% discrepancy compared to other boroughs, suggesting potential
inadequacies in physical education space and staffing levels, which may contribute to
lower student enrollment rates in these areas.
2. Staten Island boasting 51% more athletic field space compared to other boroughs,
leveraging this surplus for physical education programs could significantly enhance
students opportunities for active participation and engagement. By strategically utilizing
these athletic fields, the Staten Island school district can implement a variety of outdoor
physical education activities, such as team sports, track and field events, and
recreational games.
3. It has been observed that within the Bronx borough, Asian student population
represents only 7.64% of those receiving physical education, indicating a concerning
discrepancy when compared to other demographic groups. Whites, followed by ELL and
Blacks, are observed to be receiving less access to physical education resources and
opportunities. It is important to address the equity in physical education provision and
calls for targeted interventions to ensure equitable access to health and wellness
initiatives for all student demographics within the Bronx and beyond.
4. Ratio of full-time licensed teachers for elementary schools is consistently 20-50%
higher than the proportion of shared PE teachers with another school. This finding
suggests that elementary schools tend to allocate a greater portion of their teaching
staff to full-time positions dedicated to physical education instruction.
# Improvement
By prioritizing resource allocation and staffing decisions based on utilization patterns
and student needs, the Department of Education can work towards improving the
overall quality and effectiveness of physical education programs across the city.
Enhancing the adaptability of physical education programs among students can be
achieved through strategic initiatives such as the introduction of merit scholarships and
the recognition of individual talent. By acknowledging studentâ€™s achievements in
physical education, we can foster a culture of motivation and enthusiasm, ultimately
leading to greater student engagement and participation.
